# 📊 E-commerce Customer Order Analysis (Python Project)

## 📝 Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow created using **pure Python** (without Pandas or any external libraries).  
It simulates how an e-commerce company processes customer orders, analyzes spending behavior, and extracts valuable business insights.

The project uses Python fundamentals such as:
- Lists  
- Tuples  
- Dictionaries  
- Sets  
- Loops  
- Conditionals  
- Sorting  

This makes it an excellent beginner-to-intermediate **data analysis portfolio project**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
This project aims to:

- Organize customer orders using Python data structures  
- Group orders by customer  
- Calculate total spending per customer  
- Classify customers into:
  - High-Value Buyers  
  - Moderate Buyers  
  - Low-Value Buyers  
- Categorize products by category  
- Compute revenue per product category  
- Identify:
  - Electronics buyers  
  - Multi-category customers  
  - Customers who bought both Clothing AND Electronics  
- Generate a list of **unique products**  
- Find the **Top 3 highest-spending customers**

## 📦 Dataset Description
The project uses a manually created dataset stored in Python tuples.

Each order follows this structure:
(customer_name, product_name, price, category)
Example: ("Harry", "Laptop", 900, "Electronics")


This simulates a typical e-commerce purchase dataset.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Storage & Grouping**
- Customer names stored in a list  
- Orders stored as tuples  
- Grouped using a dictionary (customer → list of orders)

### **2️⃣ Product Categorization**
- Product → category dictionary  
- Unique categories extracted using a set  
- Category-wise product classification  

---

### **3️⃣ Customer Spending Analysis**
- Calculated total spending for each customer  
- Classified customers into:
  - High-Value (> ₹100)
  - Moderate (₹50–₹100)
  - Low-Value (< ₹50)

---

### **4️⃣ Business Insights**
✔ Total revenue per category  
✔ Unique products sold  
✔ Electronics buyers  
✔ Customers who shopped from multiple categories  
✔ Customers who bought both Electronics & Clothing  

---

### **5️⃣ Ranking**
- Identified **Top 3 spenders** using Python’s sorting capabilities  

---

### **6️⃣ Final Output**
Produces a clean console summary showing:
- Customer spending  
- Customer classification  
- Category revenue  
- Top customers  
- Multi-category customers  
- Cross-category shoppers  

---

## 📈 Example Insights (Sample Output)
- Electronics category contributed the highest revenue  
- Top spenders account for most of the sales  
- Several customers purchased from multiple categories  
- Unique product list shows catalog variety  
- Clothing + Electronics intersection reveals cross-category buyers
